<h3>Education</h3>
<p>I graduated with my Bachelor of Business Administration in Marketing in 2011 from IMM Graduate School of Marketing. Although I completed
    this education many years ago, it is the foundation for my success as a strategic, creative and logical thinker.
    Since graduating, I have taken on additional studies in SAP CRM in 2016 and C#.NET in 2019. My analytical way of thinking then directed
    my interest in Software Engineering, which I am currently pursuing with HyperionDev since January 2020."
